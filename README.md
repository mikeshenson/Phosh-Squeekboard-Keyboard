# Phosh-Squeekboard-Keyboard
Custom Phosh Squeekboard Keyboard Layout that looks like a US english 104 Keyboard layout. This needs to be use added locally because it has quick keys for text. 

How to use
--------

Copy all thse files to ~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/
File structure should look like:
~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/us.yaml
~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/number/us.yaml
~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/terminal/us.yaml

From there it should get picked up by squeekboard automatically.
